Quickstart
==========
1. Run init1.sh to initialize directories and Vundle.
2. Start vim and run :PluginInstall
3. Exit vim and run init2.sh which will (try to) build the native components of some plugins.

Details
======

Except for vundle itself which is included as a submodule, the plugins are only
defined in the vimrc. However, some plugins have a native component which must
be built after installing the plugin via :PluginInstall.
